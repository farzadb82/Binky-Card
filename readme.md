The circuit for this project can be found in blinky-card.png.

The card can be assembled by using 2 sheets of cardboard glued to each other. The circuit should be inserted inbetween the cardboard sheets. The LEDs that blink can be place in any location on the cardboard page. In my particular case, they were placed around an image of a heart on the front of the card. The electroncs should be layed flat and hot-glued onto one of the pages (see: ).
